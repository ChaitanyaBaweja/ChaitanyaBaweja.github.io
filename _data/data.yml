experiences:
    - role: Research Assistant
      time: May 2018 - June 2018
      company: The London School of Economics (LSE)
      details: |
        Worked on a Python code, which numerically solved an economic model of
        an auction market.
        - Main role was to optimize the code so that the market can be simulated smoothly
        - Explored various function approximations like Gaussian processes, and optimized the
        code to run near about 10x faster.
        - Implemented OOP to make the code modular and structured

    - role: Research Trainee
      time: June 2014 - August 2014
      company: Defense Research and Development Organization, New Delhi
      details: |
      Mentored by Dr. Sumanth Mukherji, Scientist 'F', ISSA, DRDO
        - Gathered Information and identified problems regarding existing consensus algorithms.
        - Implemented an efficient consensus protocol that reduced average overhead involved
          where nodes send more messages when they have large differences in their estimated, and
          reduce their message sending rate when the consensus is almost reached.
        - A MATLAB simulation was also developed for simulation.

    - role: Research Fellow
      time: July 2015 - December 2016
      company: University of Delhi
      details: |
      Delhi University Research Project, "Innovations towards a Sustainable World and
      Impact of the Air Quality Crisis"
        - Designed a portable air pollution measuring device(OpenVayu)
        - A user friendly pollution checking mobile application (Android)
        - Data Collection and Cleaning of Lung Capacity tests conducted on 1000 students
          from Delhi NCR region
        - Research on CO2 sensor published in IJARCSSE (ISSN - 2277 128X)
