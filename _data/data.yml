        Mentored by Dr. Sumanth Mukherji, Scientist 'F', ISSA, DRDO
        - Gathered Information and identified problems regarding existing consensus algorithms.
        - Implemented an efficient consensus protocol that reduced average overhead involved
          where nodes send more messages when they have large differences in their estimated, and
          reduce their message sending rate when the consensus is almost reached.
        - A MATLAB simulation was also developed for simulation.
