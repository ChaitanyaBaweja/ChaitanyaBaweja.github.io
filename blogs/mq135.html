Sensors are nowadays used in everyday objects and have become a part of the everyday smart life. Applications range from machinery, airplanes, aerospace, cars, medicine, robotics etc. Sensor is an object which detects events and changes in its environment. Sensors can be classified as transducers as they quantify changes in their environment through various types of output, typically electrical or optical signals. The earlier notion of using sensors to measure the basic characteristics of an object has now extended to advance characteristics by inclusion of latest technologies like image, audio, video and RF signals.</p>
<p>
Semiconductor sensors detect gases by a chemical reaction that takes place when the gas comes in direct contact with the sensor. The change in resistance is used to calculate the gas concentration. MQ135 is a stable semiconductor gas sensor which has good sensitivity to harmful gases in wide range. <a href="https://www.olimex.com/Products/Components/Sensors/SNS-MQ135/resources/SNS-MQ135.pdf" target="_blank">Datasheet of MQ135</a> is a poor indicator of its characteristics and functioning. A wide detection scope makes further analysis even difficult. <a href="http://davidegironi.blogspot.in/2014/01/cheap-co2-meter-using-mq135-sensor-with.html" target="_blank">Davide Gironi</a> suggested mathematical formulation of sensitivity characteristics to find ppm values of different gases. The formulations thus used did not incorporate the effect of physical temperature and humidity and are not performing well under diverse conditions. In this study, the impact of the physical parameters, temperature and humidity, is considered on ppm values of CO2 gas as detected by the MQ135 sensor. This influence of temperature and humidity is further incorporated in the mathematical calibrationusing multiple regression analysis and also in the proposed algorithm to find ppm value of a gas. </p>


<h2>Overview</h2>

      <p><b><a href="http://www.micropik.com/PDF/dht11.pdf" target="_blank">Digital temperature and humidity sensor (DHT11)</a></b> is a composite sensor that gives a calibrated digital signal output of the temperature and humidity. It houses the dedicated digital modules collection technology and the temperature and humidity sensing technology, to ensure that the product has high reliability and excellent long-term stability.</p><p> 
<b>MQ135 Semiconductor Sensor</b> is a stable, low cost electrochemical gas sensor suitable for detecting a wide range of VOCs and gases. It is extremely sensitive to Ammonia, Sulphide and Benzene, also sensitive to smoke and other harmful gases. The MQ series of gas sensors use a small heater inside with an electro-chemical sensor and are usually used indoors at room temperature. Their calibration preferably requires a known concentration of the measured gas. Absence of any electronic components allow usage of both AC and DC voltages </p>

<h2>Projects in the pipeline</h2>
<p>
We are currently working on VAYU, a technology that will provide people real-time information about pollution and its sources in their area. This project is an ambitious one and will be our primary focus. However, we will continue to work on different research projects and post their results on the website.
</p>


<h2>Future</h2>
      <p>
We intend to expand our operations to a much larger scale. Our projects will get more ambitious with time and our commitment stronger. We need your support. Are you ready to make a difference?
